# US_accident_analysis
An analysis to identify the key factors that contribute to accidents. By analyzing factors such as location, weather conditions, road type, time of day, and other relevant variables, the model should be able to classify accidents into different severity levels. 

Tasks Performed

1. Identify a problem. 
2. Research, identify and collect data sets which will help address the problem identified in Task 1.
3. Perform basic data cleaning
4.Understand the basic characteristics of the data by performing John Tukeyâ€™s exploratory data
analysis (EDA) [2]. 
5 Identify suitable ML, MR, and/or statistical modeling algorithms. Model and apply algorithms to
get insights into the behavior of the data. It could be classification, regression, clustering, etc.
6. Understand and explain the differences in each of the algorithms used. 
7. Visualize the analytics using appropriate charts and graphs. You can use Seaborn or any other
plotting tool.
